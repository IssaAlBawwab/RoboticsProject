# RoboticsProject

Welcome to the `RoboticsProject` repository! This repository contains various projects and code related to robotics, with a focus on facial recognition and image processing.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `facial_recognition/`: Contains code and resources for the facial recognition project.
  - `dataset/`: This folder should contain subfolders for each person, with their respective images.

## Facial Recognition

The facial recognition project uses machine learning techniques to detect and recognize faces. For the project to function correctly, you need to create a `dataset` folder inside the `facial_recognition` directory. The `dataset` folder should have subfolders for each person, with their images stored in these subfolders. Hereâ€™s an example structure:
